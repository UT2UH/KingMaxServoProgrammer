SW22-HV is certainly not waterproof and will not tolerate immersion in water. There is no o-ring at the output horn end or on the screws on bottom of case. No gaskets on the case either. Would have to be worked on to ateepmt waterproofing.

The SW22-HV pot gear appears to be replaceable by one of gears in sg90, though sg90 has slightly bigger shaft. Anyway it may be viable in the event it is stripped.
